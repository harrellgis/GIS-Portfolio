                            Even with the proliferation of modern remote sensing platforms, there remains a constant 
                            tradeoff between data coverage and data accuracy. While many lower resolution platforms 
                            provide global coverage and high revisit rates, their data products are often not appropriate 
                            for regional or site-specific analysis.

                            Some of the unresolved issues with the use of low/medium resolution products such as SPOT (20m), 
                            Landsat (30m), or MODIS (250m) are their inability to model small-scale features, and the limits 
                            of their application for highly heterogeneous landscapes. As can be seen in figure 1, the course 
                            resolution of MODIS or Landsat pixels may not be able to capture the complexity of mixed land covers. 
                            The statistical methods used by these platforms to classify land cover (i.e. majority land cover) 
                            may result in large amounts of data loss.

                                The National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) provides high-resolution 4-band aerial imagery, 
                                with a ground sample distance of 1 meter for the conterminous United States. Since 2009 this 
                                program has provided national coverage every three years, which makes it a highly accurate and 
                                reliable environmental monitoring tool.

                            The North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (NCAG&CS) uses this imagery for 
                            a variety of applications including emergency services, agricultural, and forest resource monitoring. 
                            Using NAIP imagery, this project will provide the NCAG&CS with a improved tree canopy classification 
                            method which can aid in land management practices such as timber harvesting, restoration,

                            In 2016, the NC Agricultural Dept. hired a GIS contractor to develop a data product known as the 2016 
                            Tree Canopy Project. The goal of this project was to use NAIP imagery to extract tree canopy cover at 
                            1m resolution across the state of North Carolina.

                            The null data likely comes from dark and/or heterogeneous landcover, making it hard to distinguish

                            The results produced by the 2018 classification demonstrate the strengths of the Random Trees classification 
                            algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm's resistance to overfitting allowed it to create a much higher accuracy 
                            classification. As can be seen in the Bladen Lakes example (Figure 6), the 2016 model resulted in the 
                            over-classification of tree canopy areas. This is especially apparent in areas of forest at different stages of 
                            development as well as in areas that had large amounts of vegetation, but did not contain mature tree canopies. 
                            In the DuPont State Forest example (Figure 6), the 2018 model greatly improved the classification accuracy of 
                            mixed forests and areas containing shadows cast by the mountainous topography.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These initial results also reveal useful patterns for the further development of the model. Specifically, 
                            as can be seen in the Bladen Lakes results, the land cover classes that are most often misclassified include 
                            grass and cultivated areas. This is likely due to the similarities in the spectral characteristics of these 
                            classes to forested land cover. Further refinement of training samples as well as the possible inclusion of 
                            alternate texture variables could further increase the accuracy of the model.

                            This method of image classification demonstrates a 'proof of concept' for efficiently producing high accuracy 
                            land classification models. Further development of these applications would provide a valuable land management 
                            tool for tracking multi-year land use change. This method could be applied to other land-cover types and use 
                            cases. For example, defining crop areas, flood inundation, land-use classifications.

                            Finally, the main limiting factor for utilizing this classification method is computational power. 
                            The incorporation of parallel processing and high performance computing (HPC) would drastically decrease the 
                            processing time required by this methodology. One promising avenue for the further development of this model 
                            is the Google Earth Engine platform. Not only does Earth Engine give users access to the entire catalog of NAIP 
                            imagery for North Carolina, its HPC architecture allows for complex geo-processing to be conducted at large 
                            spatial scales more efficiently. Developing a model compatible with Google Earth Engine would allow multiyear 
                            analysis of NAIP imagery. An increase in the temporal scale of this project would provide interesting insights 
                            into the dynamics of forest growth and could provide valuable information for timber harvesting and restoration 
                            activities.
